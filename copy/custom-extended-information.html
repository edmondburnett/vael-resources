<h2 id="joining">Joining The Instance</h2>

<p>First, please read our Instance Values to determine if this instance is right for you, and submit an invite request, including some details about yourself and any relevant social links, galleries, etc to give us an idea of the sort of content you post.</p>

<p>New members are absolutely welcome! The goal is to keep the instance relatively small, cozy, community-like, and harassment-free, so we just perform a quick manual review to keep out bad actors. Most signup requests will be checked within 24 hours (though typically much less).</p>

<h2 id="instance-values">Instance Values</h2>

<ul>
  <li>This is a community focused primarily on expression through creative output, projects, play, and the exploration of ideas; as opposed to typical mainstream social media algorithms that promote draining, divisive and reactionary behaviors.</li>
  <li>We recognize the urgent need for technology and society to reorient around sustainability, longevity, equality, open standards, and more ethical forms of computing and social media.</li>
</ul> 

<h3 id="ethics">Community Ethics</h3>

<p>We stand aggressively against sexism, racism, transphobia, homophobia, ableism, ethnocentrism, and speciesism.</p>

<p>Our members are also generally opposed to nationalism, religious fundamentalism, and other violent or coercive power structures.</p>

<h3 id="animal-rights">Animal Rights</h3>

<p>We subscribe to a non-speciesist worldview and would like to keep animal cruelty off of our timeline(s). Promotion of content related to the human exploitation of other animals, including non-incidental depictions of the use of animal body parts or other derivatives as food, clothing or other material for human consumption is prohibited.</p>

<p>Allowance is made for discussion in opposition or protest of these behaviours as long as any media is tagged with a Content Warning where appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="nsfw">NSFW</h3>

<p>NSFW content is permitted as long as it's on-topic to the community and appropriately tagged with a Content Warning as nsfw, i.e. original artistic works that include NSFW subject matter or imagery.</p>

<p>Perhaps obviously, any content that is clearly problematic, exploitative, non-consensual, or illegal according to US laws (where the instance's data is stored) is not allowed.</p>


<h3 id="brands-and-products">Marketing and Promotion</h3>

<p>While we heartily encourage the sharing of personal projects, even monetized ones, we discourage using your account as a primary outlet to advertise companies, products, or business ventures. You're welcome to add appropriate storefront, merch, fundraising etc links to your profile description, and to occasionally share them on the timeline.</p>

<p>Of course, using the instance to collect marketing data or to engage in unsolicited advertising via DM, email, etc is prohibited.</p>

<p>The promotion of any form of organized religion or theistic belief system is specifically prohibited.</p>


<h3 id="crypto-nfts">Cryptocurrencies and NFTs</h3>

<p>We recognize that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Many cryptocurrencies, related technologies, and the culture(s) surrounding this topic are largely incompatible with our other stated values.</li>
  <li>Artists of all kinds have been forced to deal with scams involving the theft of their artworks, which are then minted and sold as NFTs without permission. The current nature of crypto tech makes these incidents irreversible and largely unpreventable, leaving artists without recourse. In many cases this has had a chilling effect on the ability of artists to continue safely sharing their legitimate work online, especially on mainstream social media platforms.</li>
</ul> 

<p>Our policy is thus to prohibit the promotion of cryptocurrencies and NFTs on this instance. We will also limit or block any federated account or instance that appears to be used for the purposes of promoting or acquiring (whether solicited or otherwise) works of art for use as NFTs.</p>


<h2 id="staff">Staff</h2>


<p>[ <a href="https://vael.town/@edmond">@edmond</a> ]: Instance admin</p>

<p>In the event the instance gains users and eventually grows, we'll discuss plans to select other staff members if needed, and take steps to ensure the health, longevity, equity, and further documentation and open development of the community.</p>


<h2 id="privacy">Privacy, Security, Data</h2>

<p>We only store cookies and collect what data is necessary for the normal functional operation of the Mastodon software & network. No data harvesting is done for the purposes of marketing or advertising, nor will we ever sell or otherwise provide your data to any outside party, except if required by legal process or law enforcement action.</p> 

<p>See the long version here: <a href="https://vael.town/terms">https://vael.town/terms</a></p>

<p>While no security guarantee could ever be 100%, our server admin has years of experience developing, hardening, and participating in auditing the security of production applications. Every reasonable effort is made to ensure the security of the instance, servers, and data to the best of our ability.</p>

<p>We highly encourage all instance users to participate in the security of the instance by using strong passwords and <a href="https://vael.town/settings/otp_authentication">enabling two-factor authentication</a> in their account settings.</p>
