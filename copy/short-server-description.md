Vael Town is a Mastodon instance for artists, musicians, writers, developers, and other like-minded creatives who might practice and identify with concepts such as sustainability, environmentalism, self-sufficiency, veganism, ethical forms of computing, and open web standards. We strive to build a social media community that energizes rather than drains, and mutually inspires expression through creative output.
